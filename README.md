# py-faster-rcnn-with-current-version-caffe
py-faster-rcnn with current version Caffe.

<h2>Explanation</h2>

The original (https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) py-faster-rcnn's Caffe is a very old version, 
and it can't be compiled with CUDNN v7.1.

So I replace the Caffe in it, and thus this repo's py-faster-rcnn can be compiled with CUDNN v7.1.

And I didn't do any unnecessary modification. So, this fork will have the same result 
comparing to the original py-faster-rcnn.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Same as original py-faster-rcnn, and you can use CUDNN v7.1.
